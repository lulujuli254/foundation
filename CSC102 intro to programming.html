    Lucy Njoki here, and this is my first time ever programming.
     Although I'm a little rusty, I hope to improve and will keep trying because I really enjoy this.
     Meeting the professor was wonderful, I loved it.

    I'm drawn to drones for a variety of reasons. 
    Through aerial photography, they provide a distinctive viewpoint, allow for leisurely flying, and facilitate jobs like surveying and search and rescue. 
    Both professionals and enthusiasts find them fascinating and well-liked because of their adaptability, technological innovation, and potential for amusing and useful uses.
